Battleship_JAVA
===============

This is a version of the popular game Battleship developed in JAVA in 2011, as a university proyect at ENSMA.

It follows the SEEHEIM architecture, and it is separated into the Core (Bataille_Noyau) and the GUI (BatailleNavale2011).
You will need to build the core and add it to the GUI. (If you have problems you can also used the compiled version of the core in the file noyau.jar).


The rules are slightly different than in the original game:

a) Each case has many "lives", depending on the type of ship (it must be hit more than once).

b) Each ship has a different attack power. The bigger the ship, the more powerful the attack.
